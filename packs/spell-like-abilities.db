An interdimensional interface (such as a <i>bag of holding</i>) is temporarily closed. A magic item’s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.\n</p><p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.\n</p><p><i>Area Dispel: </i>When <i>dispel magic </i>is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.\n</p><p>For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the <i>dispel magic </i>spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature’s magic items are not affected.\n</p><p>For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.\n</p><p>For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the <i>dispel magic </i>spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.\n</p><p>For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the <i>dispel magic </i>spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.\n</p><p>If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by <i>monster summoning</i>) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.\n</p><p>You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.\n</p><p><i>Counterspell: </i>When <i>dispel magic </i>is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, <i>dispel magic </i>may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster’s spell.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n","snip":"Cancels magical spells and effects.","spellDuration":"Instantaneous","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"one spellcaster, creature, or object; or 20-ft.-radius burst","spellType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"showInQuickbar":false,"specialPrepared":false,"isDomainSpell":false,"specialId":null,"attack":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.D35E.spells.WVp3qvbS5faWEqmh"},"exportSource":{"world":"testorld","system":"D35E","coreVersion":"0.7.9","systemVersion":"0.88.2"}},"img":"systems/D35E/icons/spells/named-spells/dispel-magic.png","effects":[],"_id":"tEwAh29N8izSJR1N"}
