If the base creature can use weapons, the lich retains this ability. A creature with natural weapons retains those natural weapons. A lich fighting without weapons uses either its touch attack or its primary natural weapon (if it has any). A lich armed with a weapon uses its touch or a weapon, as it desires.</p>\n<p><strong>Full Attack: </strong>A lich fighting without weapons uses either its touch attack (see above) or its natural weapons (if it has any).

A lich with natural weapons can use its touch attack or its natural weaponry, as it prefers. If it chooses the latter, it deals 1d8+5 points of extra damage on one natural weapon attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A lich retains all the base creature&rsquo;s special attacks and gains those described below.

Creatures of less than 5 HD in a 60-foot radius that look at the lich must succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by a fear spell from a sorcerer of the lich&rsquo;s level. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same lich&rsquo;s aura for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Paralyzing Touch (Su)*</span>:</em> Any living creature a lich hits with its touch attack must succeed on a Fortitude save or be permanently paralyzed. Remove paralysis or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim (see the bestow curse spell description).</p>\n<p>The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a lich seems dead, though a DC 20 Spot check or a DC 15 Heal check reveals that the victim is still alive.</p>\n<p><em>Spells: </em>A lich can cast any spells it could cast while alive.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> A lich retains all the base creature&rsquo;s special qualities and gains those described below.</p>\n<p><em>Turn Resistance (Ex):</em> A lich has +4 turn resistance.</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Damage Reduction (Su)*</span>: </em>A lich&rsquo;s undead body is tough, giving the creature damage reduction 15/bludgeoning and magic.

If the base creature can use weapons, the vampire retains this ability. A creature with natural weapons retains those natural weapons. A vampire fighting without weapons uses either its slam attack or its primary natural weapon (if it has any). A vampire armed with a weapon uses its slam or a weapon, as it desires.</p>\n<p><strong>Full Attack: </strong>A vampire fighting without weapons uses either its slam attack (see above) or its natural weapons (if it has any). If armed with a weapon, it usually uses the weapon as its primary attack along with a slam or other natural weapon as a natural secondary attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Damage: </strong>Vampires have slam attacks. If the base creature does not have this attack form, use the appropriate damage value from the table below according to the vampire&rsquo;s size.

Saves have a DC of 10 + 1/2 vampire&rsquo;s HD + vampire&rsquo;s Cha modifier unless noted otherwise.</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Blood Drain (Ex)*</span>: </em>A vampire can suck blood from a living victim with its fangs by making a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the pin is maintained. On each such successful attack, the vampire gains 5 temporary hit points.</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Children of the Night (Su)*</span>: </em>Vampires command the lesser creatures of the world and once per day can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or a pack of 3d6 wolves as a standard action. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might summon other creatures of similar power.) These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Dominate (Su)*:</em></span> A vampire can crush an opponent&rsquo;s will just by looking onto his or her eyes. This is similar to a gaze attack, except that the vampire must use a standard action, and those merely looking at it are not affected. Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a Will save or fall instantly under the vampire&rsquo;s influence as though by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet.</p>\n<p><em>Create Spawn (Su): </em>A humanoid or monstrous humanoid slain by a vampire&rsquo;s energy drain rises as a vampire spawn (see the Vampire Spawn entry) 1d4 days after burial.</p>\n<p>If the vampire instead drains the victim&rsquo;s Constitution to 0 or lower, the victim returns as a spawn if it had 4 or less HD and as a vampire if it had 5 or more HD. In either case, the new vampire or spawn is under the command of the vampire that created it and remains enslaved until its master&rsquo;s destruction. At any given time a vampire may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit are created as free-willed vampires or vampire spawn. A vampire that is enslaved may create and enslave spawn of its own, so a master vampire can control a number of lesser vampires in this fashion. A vampire may voluntarily free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be enslaved again.</p>\n<p><em>Energy Drain (Su):</em> Living creatures hit by a vampire&rsquo;s slam attack (or any other natural weapon the vampire might possess) gain two negative levels. For each negative level bestowed, the vampire gains 5 temporary hit points. A vampire can use its energy drain ability once per round.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> A vampire retains all the special qualities of the base creature and gains those described below.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Alternate Form (Su)*:</em></span> A vampire can assume the shape of a bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard action. While in its alternate form, the vampire loses its natural slam attack and dominate ability, but it gains the natural weapons and extraordinary special attacks of its new form. It can remain in that form until it assumes another or until the next sunrise. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might allow other forms.)</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Damage Reduction (Su)*: </em></span>A vampire has damage reduction 10/silver and magic. A vampire&rsquo;s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>\n<p><em>Fast Healing (Ex): </em>A vampire heals 5 points of damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, it automatically assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can travel up to nine miles in 2 hours.) Any additional damage dealt to a vampire forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest in its coffin, a vampire is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Gaseous Form (Su)*: </em></span>As a standard action, a vampire can assume gaseous form at will as the spell (caster level 5th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Resistances (Ex)*: </em></span>A vampire has resistance to cold 10 and electricity 10.</p>\n<p><em>Spider Climb (Ex): </em>A vampire can climb sheer surfaces as though with a @Compendium[D35E.spells.Z5JXBkkKvoklXyno]{Spider Climb} spell.</p>\n<p><em>Turn Resistance (Ex): </em>A vampire has +4 turn resistance.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Abilities*: </strong></span>Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +6, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4.

The creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature) must have a Charisma score of at least 6.</p>\n<p>A ghost uses all the base creature&rsquo;s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.</p>\n<p><strong>Size and Type:</strong> The creature&rsquo;s type changes to undead. Do not recalculate the creature&rsquo;s base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. It gains the incorporeal subtype. Size is unchanged.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> All current and future Hit Dice become d12s.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed: </strong>Ghosts have a fly speed of 30 feet, unless the base creature has a higher fly speed, with perfect maneuverability.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class: </strong>Natural armor is the same as the base creature&rsquo;s but applies only to ethereal encounters. When the ghost manifests (see below), its natural armor bonus is +0, but it gains a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma modifier or +1, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Attack: </strong>A ghost retains all the attacks of the base creature, although those relying on physical contact do not affect creatures that are not ethereal.</p>\n<p><strong>Full Attack: </strong>A ghost retains all the attacks of the base creature, although those relying on physical contact do not affect creatures that are not ethereal.</p>\n<p><strong>Damage: </strong>Against ethereal creatures, a ghost uses the base creature&rsquo;s damage values. Against nonethereal creatures, the ghost usually cannot deal physical damage at all but can use its special attacks, if any, when it manifests (see below).</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>A ghost retains all the special attacks of the base creature, although those relying on physical contact do not affect nonethereal creatures. The ghost also gains a manifestation ability plus one to three other special attacks as described below. The save DC against a special attack is equal to 10 + 1/2 ghost&rsquo;s HD + ghost&rsquo;s Cha modifier unless otherwise noted.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Corrupting Gaze (Su)*</em></span>: A ghost can blast living beings with a glance, at a range of up to 30 feet. Creatures that meet the ghost&rsquo;s gaze must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 2d10 points of damage and 1d4 points of Charisma damage.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Corrupting Touch (Su)*</em></span>: A ghost that hits a living target with its incorporeal touch attack deals 1d6 points of damage. Against ethereal opponents, it adds its Strength modifier to attack and damage rolls. Against nonethereal opponents, it adds its Dexterity modifier to attack rolls only.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Draining Touch (Su)*</em>:</span> A ghost that hits a living target with its incorporeal touch attack drains 1d4 points from any one ability score it selects. On each such successful attack, the ghost heals 5 points of damage to itself. Against ethereal opponents, it adds its Strength modifier to attack rolls only. Against nonethereal opponents, it adds its Dexterity modifier to attack rolls only.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Frightful Moan (Su)*</em>:</span> A ghost can emit a frightful moan as a standard action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic necromantic mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the moan cannot be affected by the same ghost&rsquo;s moan for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><em>Horrific Appearance (Su)*</em>: Any living creature within 60 feet that views a ghost must succeed on a Fortitude save or immediately take 1d4 points of Strength damage, 1d4 points of Dexterity damage, and 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A creature that successfully saves against this effect cannot be affected by the same ghost&rsquo;s horrific appearance for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Malevolence (Su)*</em></span>: Once per round, an ethereal ghost can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th or the ghost&rsquo;s Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be manifested and it must try move into the target&rsquo;s space; moving into the target&rsquo;s space to use the malevolence ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save (DC 15 + ghost&rsquo;s Cha modifier). A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same ghost&rsquo;s malevolence for 24 hours, and the ghost cannot enter the target&rsquo;s space. If the save fails, the ghost vanishes into the target&rsquo;s body.</p>\n<p><em>Manifestation (Su)</em>: Every ghost has this ability. A ghost dwells on the Ethereal Plane and, as an ethereal creature, it cannot affect or be affected by anything in the material world. When a ghost manifests, it partly enters the Material Plane and becomes visible but incorporeal on the Material Plane. A manifested ghost can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, or spells, with a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source. A manifested ghost can pass through solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass through armor. A manifested ghost always moves silently. A manifested ghost can strike with its touch attack or with a ghost touch weapon (see Ghostly Equipment, below). A manifested ghost remains partially on the Ethereal Plane, where is it not incorporeal. A manifested ghost can be attacked by opponents on either the Material Plane or the Ethereal Plane. The ghost&rsquo;s incorporeality helps protect it from foes on the Material Plane, but not from foes on the Ethereal Plane.</p>\n<p>When a spellcasting ghost is not manifested and is on the Ethereal Plane, its spells cannot affect targets on the Material Plane, but they work normally against ethereal targets. When a spellcasting ghost manifests, its spells continue to affect ethereal targets and can affect targets on the Material Plane normally unless the spells rely on touch. A manifested ghost&rsquo;s touch spells don&rsquo;t work on nonethereal targets.</p>\n<p>A ghost has two home planes, the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. It is not considered extraplanar when on either of these planes.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Telekinesis (Su)*</em>:</span> A ghost can use telekinesis as a standard action (caster level 12th or equal to the ghost&rsquo;s HD, whichever is higher). When a ghost uses this power, it must wait 1d4 rounds before using it again.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities</strong>: A ghost has all the special qualities of the base creature as well as those described below.</p>\n<p><em>Rejuvenation (Su)</em>: In most cases, it&rsquo;s difficult to destroy a ghost through simple combat: The &ldquo;destroyed&rdquo; spirit will often restore itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. A ghost that would otherwise be destroyed returns to its old haunts with a successful level check (1d20 + ghost&rsquo;s HD) against DC 16. As a rule, the only way to get rid of a ghost for sure is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace.
