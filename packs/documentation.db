If you enter a number in this field, Progression Table in Description tab will be automatically generated</li>\n<li>Saving Throws&nbsp;- Saving Throw progression curves for the class. They can be&nbsp;High,&nbsp;Low&nbsp;or&nbsp;None.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"additional-class-features\">Additional Class Features</h2>\n<p>Additional class features allow for controlling some built in mechanics, like Sneak Attack and Turn Undead.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn/Rebuke Undead Formula&nbsp;- formula that is used to claculate Turn Undead level for class. Can be used for stacking levels between multiple classes that have Turn/Rebuke undead ability</li>\n<li>Sneak Attack Level Stack Group&nbsp;- this value is used for stacking Sneak Attack.

These abilities will be displayed in class progression table.</p>\n<h1 id=\"leveling-up-and-setting-hit-points\">Leveling up and setting Hit Points</h1>\n<p>System supports two version of levelling up you character - proper Class Progression that calculates Skills correctly and simplified, class based Leveling. You can Switch between two system using \"Use Class Progression\" checkbox.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-class-progression\">Using Class Progression</h2>\n<p>Class Progression makes configuring classes more similar to pen and paper leveling up. Instead of setting class level directly, you assign which class level was raised on which character level.</p>\n<p>Using Class Progression allows you to set skill points and HP for each level. To do so, click on arrow inside unconfigured levels - this will open Level Up Details windows where you can select a Class, roll Hit Points for level and assign Skill Points. Your character Class levels, Hit Points and Skill Ranks will be automatically updated.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When using Class Progression, skill ranks on Skills tab on characher sheet are calculated automatically and overwritten. To set up skills you need to set them for each level separately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"simple-leveling\">Simple Leveling</h2>\n<p>To Level up a class, you need to set number in&nbsp;Level&nbsp;input to be the correct value. After setting the value, ECL of character will be updated to reflect new class level, and all abilities that are related to a class also use the new value.</p>\n<p>To set class Hit Points - Hit Points your characted gained from rolls each level, wthoug Constitution modifier - you need to set number in&nbsp;Hit Points&nbsp;input to be the correct value. After setting the value, Character HP will be updated.</p>\n<h1 id=\"class-progression-and-features\">Class Progression and Features</h1>\n<p>All Base and Prestige classes available in system end expansion module Class compendiums come with active Class Features programmed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"compendium-classes-and-class-features\">Compendium Classes and Class Features</h2>\n<p>If you drag and drop Class from compendium, class will have \"Automatic Class Features\" option enabled by default. This means that when leveling up, system will automatically add missing Class Features to your Character (and remove them if you reduce level in Class Details).</p>\n<p>If multiple class features provide the same feature - and it's effects do not stack - feature will be added only once. In case of features that can be added multiple times - like Bonus Feat (Fighter) Class Feature of a Fighter - it will be added correct number of times to character sheet.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Class Features that are borderd will be added to Character automatically if using Automatic Class Features, but can be dragged and dropped directly on character sheet if you are using Manual Class Features (or using characters with classes from Compendium created before version 0.85).</p>\n<p>You can disable Automatic Class Features even for classes imported from Compendium. To do this, navigate to details tabs and uncheck \"Automatic Class Features\" option. All previously added features for that class will be removed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"custom-classes-and-class-features\">Custom Classes and Class Features</h2>\n<p>Classes created by you, or coming from modules not supporting automatic class features may not have ability to have automatic class features added to Character Sheet. In this case you can either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add existing class feature from Compendium</li>\n<li>Create completely new Class Feature manually</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To add Class Feature manually open Character Sheet on tab Features -&gt; Class Features and find&nbsp;+ Add&nbsp;button located in the header of Class Feature List.</p>\n<p>You can read more on how to create your own class abilities here - @Compendium[D35E.docs.iHtmUlFOGfTyrCFE]{B2. Advanced - Custom Class Abilities}</p>\n<h2 id=\"alternative-class-features\">Alternative Class Features</h2>\n<p>System also supports Alternative Class Features. To use them, you can leverage Custom Classes and Class Features system - you can disable existing abilities from a Class and add new at correct levels.&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 id=\"templates\">Templates</h1>\n<p>Template system allows you easily change an actor by adding a Template like Half-Celestial or Vampire. Templates are - in essence - classes. One main difference between Template and a Class or Racial HD is that Templates do not count to the total HD of a character and their level is always set to the HD of a creature.</p>\n<p>Templates also allow changing ECL of a character - you can set this up in Configuration page.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some templates require doing manual changes to an actor. If this is needed, information will be provided in the Template description.</p>\n</blockquote>","_id":"bBAvAgpkVvh2Pbw5"}
